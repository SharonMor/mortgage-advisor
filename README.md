## Overview
This project is a part of the "Client-Server" course taught by Tamir at ORT Braude College. It is designed to demonstrate a full-stack application incorporating both client and server-side functionalities.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:**
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
  - **Axios**: A JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests.
  - **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
  - **Styled Components**: A library for writing CSS in JS to style React components.

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
  - **Firebase Firestore**: A NoSQL database provided by Firebase for storing and synchronizing data in real time.
  - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
  - **Nodemailer**: A module for Node.js applications to allow email sending.

## Running the Project Locally
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Root Folder:**
   - Navigate to the root folder of the project.
   - Run the command `npm run start` to start the project. This will start both the frontend and backend parts of the application.
### Another Way - Run Client and Server Seperatly (2 terminals)
2. **Client:**
   - Go to the `client` directory within the project folder.
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server for the React frontend.

3. **Server:**
   - Navigate to the `server` directory within the project folder.
   - Run `npm run server` to start the backend server using Node.js and Express.js.

Ensure that all the dependencies are installed in both the client and server directories by running `npm install` in each directory before starting the servers.

**~Make Sure .env Files exist on client/server root folders~**

## Deployment
The deployment stack details will be added later, which will include information on how to deploy and manage the application in a production environment.

## Contribution
This project is part of an educational course, and contributions are managed by the course participants and the instructor.
